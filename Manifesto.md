# Manifesto

# The disclaimer
When I state something, I do so from within the confines of my own limitations; from behind the paucity of my experience and within the limitations of the data available to me, from a viewpoint not without biases, known and unknown, not without sloppiness, inconsistency and mutability. I make statements conscious of my own limited ability to integrate and process what limited information I use to support them. Everything I grope towards is forever subject to revision, refinement, disavowal, rewording. With this qualification always and ever present, my intention remains to be clear and true, insofar as that is possible at all.

This document should not be taken to be comprehensive, complete, nor consistent.

> Every philosophical discovery which I made so flattered my conceit that I often imagined myself to be a great man discovering new truths for the benefit of humanity

> -- Leo Tolstoy, Childhood, Boyhood, Youth

## Truths

1. Happiness is truth. Happiness is the only thing you know to be good.
2. The quest is how to live a happy life
3. All knowledge is contingent. Everything changes. Beliefs and goals change over time.
4. Death is certain

## Beliefs

### Level 1 Beliefs
* We cannot know what the truth of reality is
* Logic and rationality and scepticism are seductive in their power, but there are gaps at their foundation that are unresolved to me at present. If you doubt everything, the only thing you can not doubt is that you are a thinking thing, as per Descartes. If you cannot know that your senses are not deceived, and that nothing in the world is as you perceive it to be, then how can you be sure that there is such a thing as rational argument in the 'real' reality beyond the access of your potentially deluded senses? That logic is even a concept that holds? Of course it might seem that this is the case -- but how do you know that what you sense and feel and think are in any way correspondent to reality? There is an element of faith required to believe that there is such a thing as external truth, and there is no disinterested reason that I have seen to make this leap of faith; the only reason I can find is a practical one -- that it is expedient to assume that the world is as it appears. We make this assumption because we are conditioned to do so and life would be impossible without such a leap. I cannot find a convincing argument that ensures that I am not a Brain in a Vat nor deceived by an evil demon. Is it not possible that there could exist an overall illogical system which nevertheless contained within itself thinking things that perceived logical relations in their thought and their observable part of the system?
* Either we are in a determined universe, in which case all of our actions are pre-ordained and we are merely automata with the convincing illusion of agency, of free will, or we are in a probabilistic universe, where an element of pure randomness rules, where nothing but chaos is at the root of all perceived order
* Problems then arise about law, ethics, morality... If my actions are part of a physical system the states of which were determined since the beginning of time, how could I ever have behaved any other way than the way I eventually did? Likewise in an indeterminate universe; if everything is resting on foundations of randomness, how can I be regarded as being a self-directed agent with purposeful, self-willed actions? There is no evident way to operate a human society taking these apparent truths in to account, and so they must be discarded for expediency.

### Level 2 Beliefs
* As I cannot live my life with all of this uncertainty, and as I have no compulsion to end it, I must take a leap of faith and believe that the external world is as I find it and either resolve the uncertainties at a later date or ignore them altogether (the default position of most people).
* Ethics, morality, law, are human products, artefacts of evolution just as much as we are, and further down the chain they are also products of the determined or indeterminate universe within which everything is embedded, and whilst not having a solid foundation in pure reason, they do have a solid foundation within the context of a smaller, human, every-day framework of answering the question 'how can we live our lives given the world as we find it?'.
* What then can I be sure of, within the framework of the world as I find it? I know that happiness, or wellbeing, or lack-of-bad-things feels good.
* Happiness is at the root of everything. If you ask yourself, ‘what do I want out of my life?’ or ‘what do I want to do today’?, you will no doubt have a range of answers, from ‘to have a family’, ‘to succeed in my career’, or ‘to pass this exam’. But probe further — why do you want a family, why do you want a successful career or to pass this exam? Keep asking ‘why?’ and you will reach at the final answer: because all things considered you anticipate it will make you happier than not doing it. This is the difference between an instrumental good an intrinsic good. An [intrinsic good](http://philosophy.lander.edu/ethics/intrinsic.html) is not a means to something else.
* All motives for action are fundamentally selfish, in this regard; all actions are in some measure taken to gain a perceived increase in personal happiness, even if these actions appear altruistic or self-destructive.

  > All men seek happiness. This is without exception. Whatever different means they employ, they all tend to this end. The cause of some going to war, and of others avoiding it, is the same desire in both, attended with different views. The will never takes the least step but to this object. This is the motive of every action of every man, even of those who hang themselves.

  > -- Blaise Pascal

* Seeking happiness is the guiding heuristic for our behaviour. It is not infallible. When a soldier throws himself on a grenade to save his comrades, the heuristic is operating but failing to realise a longterm reward.
* Meaning and purpose bring happiness. I have found no meaning nor purpose to life through rational thought nor empirical study, but can see that when I move through my life as if I had meaning and purpose, I do so with greater ease, with more contentment and more peace of mind than if I didn't. Anything that gives a true sense of meaning or purpose is therefore to be desired, regardless of how trivial, petty, or illogical it may seem; after all, everything is resting on equally unproven ground.
* We have innate biases, needs, drives. To ignore them wholly imperils happiness. Just because these impulses and predilictions were installed in us by evolutionary processes does not mean that they are to be disregarded as not fit to form part of a rational life. To be human is to be part animal, part unthinking, part emotionally driven. It serves wellbeing to cater to these needs in some degree.
* Humans are not wholly rational creatures; in fact in many instances we are irrational. Given this, it is unreasonable to expect humans to act logically or to be swayed by logical appeal.
* And this is why things that I personally am unaffected by -- sport, religion, national pride -- are not to be regarded with contempt. They perform valid functions given humans are what they are and given the pre-conditions that formed them. To eradicate such 'irrational' things as religion is to claim that there is something more rational; but as I currently apprehend, rationality itself is ungrounded.
* Every person you see has an entire universe in their heads, each peculiarly their own and yet overlapping and overlaid on all others
* The important thing is to live minute to minute, and to realise that each moment is tolerable in itself, the sensations of the moment are if not actively positive then very infrequently negative. It is when projecting outside of the immediate moment that angst, anxiety, inadequacy creep in. Bring mind back to the moment.
* You can never know absolutely what the right course of action is
* There are fundamentally unanswerable questions — and most pertinently so in one person's lifetime

### Why people don't think about Level 1
Level 1 beliefs (which are incidentally by no means original with me; as indeed is the case with everything I think and say) threaten to swamp the believer in paralysing uncertainty, crippling doubt and destructive apathy. They demand a Level 2 to permit a livable life.

Level 1 beliefs cannot transmit widely because such beliefs do not contribute to a stable society. A stable society would favour those people who support its own stability, and so people with the constellation of characteristics that permit them to believe in Level 1 with no Level 2 would not be widely represented throughout a given population.

> False beliefs that happen to promote stable societies tend to propagate because people who hold these beliefs tend to live in stable societies, which provide the means by which false beliefs propagate.

> -- Daniel M. Gilbert, Stumbling on Happiness

And so there is a strong motivation to form level 2 beliefs that disregard level 1. There is and always will be an immense pressure to relate to the world as it appears to be. I want and need to fit in to this world. It is impossible to live with integrity and simultaneously reject everything in the world within which you live. As I have found out, it is no good rejecting and scorning everything around me as I did in my youth; this profits no one, least of all myself. Instead all of the apparently ungrounded, strange, seemingly irrational features of life that seem so alien to my disposition can be assimilated as part of a system that sanctions, condones, understands these things _by taking them on their own terms_ and understanding that this is in fact how even the most 'profound' argument begins; by taking the world as it appears to be.

### My tendency to reject level 2
* I don’t like or engage with socially normative rituals and behaviours or group activities; sport, weddings, newspapers, television, radio, dancing or Christmas or politics or pets, and so find it hard to relate and fully connect with those who do. My default position was to regard it all suspiciously and beneath me; I am now trying to destabilise my own sense of superiority and realise that things I am naturally drawn to -- art, literature, thinking, science -- are in fact no more exalted than any of the things my temperament pushes me away from.
* I have no religion, no faith, and can hardly expect to be taken seriously by those who do
* I evince no national pride, no loyalty, and thus invite the justifiable scorn and contempt of those who do
* I don't consider children to be an intrinsically good thing, and thus alienate myself from the majority
* The things I believe don’t make me or other people happier or help them to live their lives better
    - (But they do allow me to feel like a misunderstood outsider, which is familiar and comforting ground for me, which is no doubt why I cling to these beliefs)
* I overcomplicate things and question everything; an impracticable stance that throws impediments in the way of other people making the progress they care about
* I am proud, vain, cowardly, volatile, honest, enjoy being a minority of one, like to be a victim, like to not have responsibility, selfish, arrogant (think I understand my own and other people’s motives), jealous, suffer from an inferiority complex; all of which are rightly regarded as contemptible
* I don’t interact with other people unless I can see something in it for me, hypocritical; distances me from people who feel they act as part of a wider concern
* I recognise all of these things but don’t try to change myself to make my own or other people’s lives better

# Unresolved, unsorted
* Is there such thing as an axiom? Is there such thing as a primitive? Is ‘force’ or ‘gravity’ or ‘representation’ a primitive concept? Does a primitive even make sense? Does ‘make sense’ make sense? Or is it all only within a given framework. Our given framework is defined as what can be thought using human hardware and expressed using language. 
* Are all philosophical problems problems of language? i.e. ‘this sentence is false’. What do we do with a paradox? Can the universe admit a paradox?
* What is truth? 1+1=2? But of course that is true — it defines itself as true! But is there any external validity? Is there a concept of truth that can be in some way verified from without the system? Is this just a problem of language?
* what is better, time to pause and reflect, and thus time to brood and worry, or a life so busy and hemmed in by exigencies that you never have the repose or energy to apprehend the futility and insignificance.
* is fulfilment different from happiness?
* But is ‘feeling good’ the same as happiness? Not feeling pain / being free from suffering
* Buddha: craving is the root cause of all evil

Psychological Hedonism: (a descriptive theory) all people do in fact pursue pleasure. This theory holds that this is not the way people ought to be; this is the way people actually are—they naturally seek pleasure. Hence, the theory is an inductive generalisation from experience by social scientists. [Hedonism](http://philosophy.lander.edu/ethics/hedonism.html) 

* Chaos theory, computational irreducibility, Gödel’s incompleteness hypothesis, the inability to comprehend something fully, only as a model
* Intersubjective realities - web of meanings we all agree on. Dollar, nationhood, crusades. Stories we invent and believe
* Fictions that give meaning to reality

## Actions

be the source of the greatest pleasure 

People like successes. They don’t want to hear about your problems. 

time goes fast when you’re busy; you worry about things which are imminent, and often solvable. when left to your own devices you worry existentially. 

action feels better than inaction; doing something feels better than nothing because it gives you a baseline to improve on or to benchmark against. 

> “occupation is my sheet anchor — my mind would soon devour me without it.”

John Constable

> "Those only are happy who have their minds fixed on some object other than their own happiness … Aiming thus at something else, they find happiness along the way."

John Stuart Mill

people need you to give them a narrative. you might even need to give yourself a narrative. 

What you want is not a thing, like a house or an apartment, but a state of mind. Describe the state of mind. The state of mind is calm, free from anxiety, happy, occupied and fulfilled. It doesn't matter what inputs you use to achieve that output, so long as it is sustainable.

## Quotations
> Sleep on,  
Blest pair! and, O! yet happiest, if ye seek  
No happier state, and know to know no more! 

John Milton, Paradise Lost

---

> If he had smiled why would he have smiled? To reflect that each one who enters imagines himself to be the first to enter whereas he is always the last term of a preceding series even if the first term of a succeeding one, each imagining himself to be first, last, only and alone whereas he is neither first nor last nor only nor alone in a series originating in and repeated to infinity.

James Joyce, Ulysses

---

> And then, every morning, he sets himself afresh to the task of earning his bread; and while his hands earn his bread, his dorsal column gains pride, his brain gathers ideas. His task finished, he returns to ineffable ecstasies, to contemplation, to joys; he beholds his feet set in afflictions, in obstacles, on the pavement, in the nettles, sometimes in the mire; his head in the light. He is firm serene, gentle, peaceful, attentive, serious, content with little, kindly; and he thanks God for having bestowed on him those two forms of riches which many a rich man lacks: work, which makes him free; and thought, which makes him dignified.

Victor Hugo, Les Misérables

---

> In town a man can live for a hundred years and never notice that he's long been dead and buried. There's never any time to study your conscience; you're busy all the time. There's business, social life, looking after your health, keeping up with the arts, attending to the health of your children, arranging their education... Well, that's how we lived, and that way we didn't feel so acutely the pain caused by the fact of our living together.

 Leo Tolstoy, Childhood, Boyhood, Youth

> Algebra applies to the clouds, the radiance of the star benefits the rose--no thinker would dare to say that the perfume of the hawthorn is useless to the constellations. Who could ever calculate the path of a molecule? How do we know that the creations of worlds are not determined by falling grains of sand? Who can understand the reciprocal ebb and flow of the infinitely great and the infinitely small, the echoing of causes in the abyss of being and the avalanches of creation? A mite has value; the small is great, the great is small. All is balanced in necessity; frightening vision for the mind. There are marvelous relations between beings and things, in this inexhaustible whole, from sun to grub, there is no scorn, each needs the other. Light does not carry terrestrial perfumes into the azure depths without knowing what it does with them; night distributes the stellar essence to the sleeping plants. Every bird that flies has the thread of the infinite in its claw. Germination includes the hatching of a meteor and the tap of a swallow's beak breaking the egg, and it guides the birth of the earthworm, and the advent of Socrates. Where the telescope ends, the microscope begins. Which of the two has a greater view? Choose. A bit of mold is a pleiad of flowers; a nebula is an anthill of stars. The same promiscuity, and still more wonderful, between the things of the intellect and material things. Elements and principles are mingled, combined, espoused, multiplied one by another, to the point that the material world, and the moral world are brought into the same light. Phenomena are perpetually folded back on themselves. In the vast cosmic changes, universal life comes and goes in unknown quantities, rolling everything up in the invisible mystery of the emanations, using everything, losing no dream from any single sleep, sowing a microscopic animal here, crumbling a star there, oscillating and gyrating, making a force of light, and an element of thought, disseminated and indivisible dissolving all, that geometric point, the self; reducing everything to the soul-atom; making everything blossom into God; entangling from the highest to the lowest, all activities in the obscurity of a dizzying mechanism, linking the flight of an insect to the movement of the earth, subordinating--who knows, if only by the identity of the law--the evolutions of the comet in the firmament to the circling of the protozoa in the drop of water. A machine made of mind. Enormous gearing, whose first motor is the gnat, and whose last is the zodiac.

Leo Tolstoy, What is Art?

> I know that the majority of people who are not only regarded as intelligent but are indeed intelligent, capable of understanding the most difficult scientific, mathematical and philosophical reasonings, are very rarely capable of understanding a most simple and obvious truth, if it is such as requires that they admit that a judgement they have formed about something, sometimes with great effort, a judgement they are proud of, which they have taught to others, on the basis of which they have arranged  their entire life -- that this judgement may be wrong. 

Leo Tolstoy, What is Art?

---

> To live as wealthy, idle people live, the women especially, away from nature and from animals, in artificial conditions, with muscles atrophied or abnormally developed by gymnastics, and with a weakened vital energy, would be impossible were it not for what is called art, were it not for the diversion, the amusement which turn these people's eyes from the meaninglessness of their lives and saves them from the boredom that oppresses them.

Leo Tolstoy, What is Art?

> No situation is more harmful for artistic productivity than the situation of complete security and luxury in which artists usually live in our society.

> [Ruskin] Practically, then, at present, 'advancement in life' means, becoming conspicuous in life; obtaining a position which shall be acknowledged by others to be respectable or honourable. We do not understand by this advancement, in general, the mere making of money, but the being known to have made it; not the accomplishment of any great aim, but the being seen to have accomplished it. In a word, we mean the gratification of our thirst for applause.

Marcel Proust and John Ruskin on Reading

---

> You will begin to perceive that what _you_ thought was a matter of no serious importance;- that your thoughts on any subject are perhaps not the clearest and wisest that could be arrived at thereupon:- in fact, that unless you are a very singular person, you cannot be said to have any 'thoughts' at all; that you have no materials for them, in any serious matters

Marcel Proust and John Ruskin on Reading

---

> My second sentiment was a craving for love. I wanted every one to know me and to love me. I wanted to be able to utter my name—Nicola Irtenieff—and at once to see every one thunderstruck at it, and come crowding round me and thanking me for something or another, I hardly knew what. My third sentiment was the expectation of some extraordinary, glorious happiness that was impending—some happiness so strong and assured as to verge upon ecstasy

Leo Tolstoy, Childhood, Boyhood, Youth

---

> It seemed to me that it would be so easy and natural for me to tear myself away from my past and to remake it—to forget all that had been, and to begin my life, with all its relations, anew—that the past never troubled me, never clung to me at all.

Leo Tolstoy, Childhood, Boyhood, Youth

---

> It is easy in the world to live after the world’s opinion;
 It is easy in solitude to live after our own;   
but the great man is he  
who in the midst of the crowd   
keeps with perfect sweetness;  
the independence of solitude.

 Ralph Waldo Emerson, Self Reliance

> In short, the production of wealth does not necessarily make individuals happy, but it does serve the needs of the economy, which serves the needs of a stable society, which serves as a network for the propagation of delusional beliefs about happiness and wealth.

> This particular false belief is a super-replicator because holding it causes us to engage in the very activities that perpetuate it. 

- Daniel M. Gilbert, Stumbling on Happiness

---

> 'Children bring happiness' is a super-replicator. The belief-transmission network of which we are a part cannot operate without a continuously replenished supply of people to do the transmitting, thus the belief that children are a source of happiness becomes a part of our cultural wisdom simply because the opposite belief unravels the fabric of any society that holds it.

Daniel M. Gilbert, Stumbling on Happiness

> The belief-transmission game is rigged so that we _must_ believe that children and money bring happiness, regardless of whether such beliefs are true.

> So perhaps happiness is synchronizing one’s personal delusions of meaning with the prevailing collective delusions. As long as my personal narrative is in line with the narrative of the people around me, I can convince myself that my life is meaningful and find happiness in that conviction.
