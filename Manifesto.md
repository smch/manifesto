# Control
Everything you do is about control. You are either controlling yourself, or you are controlling somebody or something else. 

## Controlling the world
Whenever you act in the world, you exert control. Life seeks to grow and expand its control by controlling the physical environment, resources, and other life.

## Controlling your need for control
Rather than trying directly to control the external world around you, you can turn your need for control inwards and focus on self-control. You can try to control your emotions, responses and desires. This gives you an _indirect_ sense of control over the world around you, because you reduce its power to control how you feel. 

## Escaping your need for control
Even if you focus entirely on self-control you haven't escaped from your need for control; you have just turned it inwards on to yourself. The need for control is persistent. It is there even if you are not conscious of it. If you are hungry and you eat, you gain control over your hunger. If you are hungry and you don't eat, you are controlling your impulse to eat. Whenever you make a conscious decision and act on it, you are exercising control.

Can you make a conscious decision to relinquish all control? You would have to remain indifferent, totally detached from acting on any preferences whatsoever. To live without preference is to have no values, to neither seek nor avoid anything whatsoever. This is the opposite of life, and yet if you seek death you still exercise your agency and seek to control your life by ending it.

It is impossible to be alive, conscious and to escape the need for control.

## Life as embodied control
In fact life itself is control, whether it is conscious or not. Life is a system of self-perpetuating order, and order requires control. To metabolise, to grow, to eat, to move, is to control. Life is control.
